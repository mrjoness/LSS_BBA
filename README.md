# LSS Applied to DEShaw simulations of the BBA (PDB: 1FME)

### The collab notebook loads the Ca positions of BBA simulations with stride=50 and three pre-trained models for the SRV, MDN, and DDPM. Walkthrough includes analysis of implied timescales, eigenvector correlations with input features, and differences in metastable states.

### SRV:
- Trained on 10 x 100_000 trajectories of BBA
- Features are all pairwise distances between Ca positions

### SRV:
